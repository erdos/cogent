# cogent

A small rule engine with Equality Saturation<sup>[1]</sup> in Clojure.

## Usage

1. Install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
2. Clone this repository
2. Enter the REPL: `$ lein repl`

Check if two expressions are in the same e-class:

```Clojure
cogent.core=> (congruent? 3 '(d x (* 3 x)))
true

congruent.core=> (tautology? '(or x (and true (not x))))
true
```
